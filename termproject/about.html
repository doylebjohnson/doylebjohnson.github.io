            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p id="p1">I am originally from the San Francisco Bay Area and have lived here most of my life. After graduating from University of California, Berkeley, I worked
            as a Computer Systems Engineer in Silicon Valley for four years before going to law school. I have always enjoyed the intersection of both technology and law.I 
            now live in Moraga, CA, which is a small suburb east of San Francisco.  I enjoy Moraga as it is nestled in the hills, with many hiking trails and <strong>wildlife</strong> to enjoy.

            <p id="p2">I am a registered Patent Attorney with an Electrical Engineering background and have over 25 years of experience litigating complex patent cases. 
            I also have many years of experience prosecuting patent applications involving complex technologies before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
            In addition, I have represented clients in IPR proceedings.  I handle trademark prosecution matters, domain name disputes and licensing agreements. 
            I counsel clients concerning intellectual property rights both in the US and internationally.</p>

            <p id="p3">My areas of technical expertise include computer hardware and software, communications technologies, and analog and digital circuits. 
            I have been involved in patent matters involving virtually every facet of electronics – from circuit design, wired and wireless communications, 
            semiconductor manufacturing technologies, and consumer electronic devices. With a background in Amateur Radio, and an FCC General Radiotelephone license, 
            I have many years of experience with radio (“wireless”) technologies, including cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. In addition, I have a certificate in 
            Java programming, and have written and prosecuted Java patent applications for Sun Microsystems.
